Instructions to run the code:

I have submitted two code files in this project -

1. Implementation of privacy/Utility.
2. Plotting utility(after implementing privacy to the class attribute) graph.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the code:
1. To view the code use IDLE for python(for proper indentation and best functionality use version 3.7.1)
2. This is can be in run in two methods -
   a. Directly import the file into a software like Anaconda or Spyder.
      i. Navigate to the folder of my code.
     ii. Check the path
    iii. Run the ".py" file

   b. If the path of python is already loaded in the command prompt with python.exe, there are no special instructions. 
      i. Just use the command "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\python.exe" to get the execution running.
     ii. Run the ".py" file

Note: The Doc test and Unit test can be done in order to search for a particular module in submitted python "Privacy/Utility.py" code
      by using "py.test"tool which breaks my code into modules.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The graph submitted in my report infers the following:

1. The utility of the "Work Class" attribute is obtained as the peak point in the graph drawn for this attribute.
2. After implementation of privacy to the "class" attribute" this point is marked again and infer for best utility.
3. The privacy of "Class" attribute is calculated using the amount of "privacy loss" by versatility and information loss.
